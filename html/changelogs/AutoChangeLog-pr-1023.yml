changes: 
  - tweak: "Map votes and rotation tweaked further. Map vote will automatically run as the shuttle leaves, and if no map vote has been run by round end map rotation will trigger."
  - tweak: "The last 3 maps are now stored, up from 2. This means any map run twice in the last four (including current) rounds are disqualified from map vote and map rotation."
